As of right now, Ouma is a major work-in-progress. The plan for him is a bot with endless viability. From his current planned features to his features already implimented, Ouma can do calculus; graph; use quizlet; create trivia games; provide comfort; play simple games; track your game status' and levels; leader board; play music; administrate a guild; and more to come.

## Disclaimer
Ouma Bot is a **non-profit** bot. His character, Ouma Kokichi, is property of Spike Chungsoft. He appears in Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony. Please support the creators of Ouma Kokichi and his doomed classmates by buying DRv3 for the PS4 or Vita. I claim no ownership over him and simply wanted to use him as the bots cover since I enjoyed his character so much.
